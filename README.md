# escapefromjail
You are a French prisoner who is currently spending a life sentence in the notorious prison of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Discontent with your situation, you decide to hatch a plan to escape. However, the road out is not an easy one. You have thirty minutes from the time you start to escape until the U.S. Navy eventually catches you. Good luck.
