# escapefromjail

You are a French prisoner who is currently spending a life sentence in the notorious prison of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Discontent with your situation, you decide to  hatch a plan to escape. However, the road out is not an easy one. You have thirty minutes from the time you start to escape until the U.S. Navy eventually catches you. Good luck.

Game Overview:
At every turn you can make in the prison, there is either a puzzle, riddle, or some trivia about the United States that must be answered correctly in order to proceed in the direction you choose to go. In addition to this, there are various items you must pick up along the way that you will need to reach the final opening of the prison, the location of which is completely unknown. 

Game Philosophy:
This game comes out as a puzzle game in 2D accessible to anyone. For most advanced players, solving the riddles fast enough allows you to have enough time to visit the entire stage and look for clues to answer the real question you're asking yourself: Why am I here in the first place?
